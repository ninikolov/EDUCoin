# Interplanetary Educational System

The Interplanetary Educational System (IPES) is a personal, secure and widely recognised blockchain solution for storing international academic achievements and individual educational growth. It enables universal ECTS credits transfer, eliminating fraud and incentivises quality education.

This repo contains a minimal implementation of some of the IPES functionality that was created during the ETH BIOTS week 2018.
